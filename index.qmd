The S&P 500 is a critical aspect of today's economy. Its performance impacts the wellbeing and state of the economy.   It is comprised of multiple companies available on the stock market.  
Below displayed are historical events affecting the S&P 500 and the overall stock market on a graph.

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(quantmod)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Get historical data for the S&P 500
getSymbols("^GSPC", from = "2000-01-01", to = Sys.Date())
sp500 <- Cl(GSPC) %>% as.data.frame()
sp500$Date <- as.Date(row.names(sp500))
names(sp500) <- c("Close", "Date")

# Define significant historical events
events <- data.frame(
  Date = as.Date(c("2000-03-10", "2001-09-11", "2008-09-15", "2020-03-16", "2022-01-01")),
  Event = c("Dot-com Bubble", "9/11 Attacks", "2008 Recession", "COVID-19 Pandemic", "Recent Technology Boom")
)

# Ensure event dates are in the stock data date range
events <- events %>% filter(Date %in% sp500$Date)

# Match event dates with closing prices
events <- events %>%
  left_join(sp500, by = "Date")

# Create the plot
ggplot(sp500, aes(x = Date, y = Close)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  geom_point(data = events, aes(x = Date, y = Close), color = "red", size = 3) +
  geom_text(data = events, aes(x = Date, y = Close, label = Event), 
            vjust = -1, hjust = -0.1, color = "red", angle = 45) +
  labs(title = "S&P 500 Movement with Significant Events",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Closing Price") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```


**Significant events create rapid volatility in the stock market.**  
However, the stock market tends to reliably rise in the long-term.
